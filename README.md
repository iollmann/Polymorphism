# Polymorphism
An educational exercise implementing C++ polymorphism in C

My son is taking his first college programming class (at his actual college) which teaches programming
in C. He's been doing C++ for the last year. The look of distaste on his face was memorable. 
You can actually do quite a lot of C++ in C. It is just more work. Templates are definitely
out, but polymorphism is possible as this exercise shows. It may provide an insight into 
how C++ actuall works.
